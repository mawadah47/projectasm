 Idea: -
A program that makes the arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
How the program works: -
 The user enters the first number, then the second number, then they choose the wanted operation, 
 then the program prints only the result in the case of add, sub and mul operations
 ,but with the division operation it prints the result and the modulus after it.
